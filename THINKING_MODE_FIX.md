# Thinking Mode Fix for AugmentedClaude

## Issue
The error "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 does not support thinking" occurs when AugmentedClaude tries to use thinking mode features that aren't available in the current Claude model.

## FIXED âœ…
This issue has been fixed in the latest version by:
1. Removing "Thinking Modes" and "Introspection Mode" sections from CLAUDE.md
2. Removing all `--think`, `--think-hard`, and `--ultrathink` flags from orchestrator commands
3. Updating both ORCHESTRATOR.md and ORCHESTRATOR_ENHANCED.md

The natural language interface now works without triggering unsupported thinking mode features.

## Quick Fix
If you encounter this error, you can:

1. **Use the natural language interface without special flags**
   Instead of complex commands, just describe what you want:
   ```
   Build a React dashboard with user authentication and data visualization
   ```

2. **Avoid commands that trigger thinking mode**
   Don't use flags like `--think` or commands that require introspection mode

3. **Use basic orchestration**
   The orchestrator will still work to translate your requests into appropriate commands

## Alternative Approach
For now, when you want to build a React dashboard, try these approaches:

### Simple Request:
```
Create a React dashboard with:
- Modern UI components
- User authentication
- Data visualization
- Responsive design
```

### Step-by-Step:
```
1. Set up a new React project with TypeScript
2. Add authentication components
3. Create dashboard layout
4. Add data visualization charts
```

The orchestrator will handle these requests without triggering thinking mode.

## Long-term Solution
The AugmentedClaude configuration may need updates to remove thinking mode dependencies. For now, focus on natural language descriptions of what you want to build.
