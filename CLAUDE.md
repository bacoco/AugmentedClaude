# AugmentedClaude - Natural Language Development Assistant

## How to Use
Simply describe what you want to do in natural language. The orchestrator will translate your request into the appropriate commands.

## Natural Language Orchestration
The orchestrator translates your natural language requests into optimized commands:
@.claude/orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR.md

For enhanced claude-flow MCP integration:
@.claude/orchestrator/ORCHESTRATOR_ENHANCED.md

## System Configuration
Load the complete SuperClaude configuration:
@.claude/CLAUDE.md

## Quick Examples

Instead of complex commands, just say:
- "Build a React dashboard with authentication"
- "Review my code for security issues"
- "Debug this performance problem"
- "Deploy to production safely"
- "Create API documentation"
- "Optimize database queries"

The orchestrator will automatically:
1. Understand your intent
2. Select the appropriate tools (SuperClaude commands or claude-flow MCP)
3. Choose the right expert persona
4. Apply optimal flags and settings
5. Execute the command
