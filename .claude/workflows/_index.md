## Workflow Composition

### Parallel Workflow Execution
Some workflows can run in parallel:

**Development Phase**:
- Feature Development + UI Testing
- Multiple Bug Resolutions
- Performance Audit + Security Assessment

**Analysis Phase**:
- Market Research + Technical Research
- Security Assessment + Compliance Audit

### Sequential Dependencies
Workflows that must run in sequence:

1. **Launch Preparation**:
   ```
   Security Assessment → Bug Resolution → Performance Audit → Feature Development
   ```

2. **Major Release**:
   ```
   Market Research → Feature Development → Security Assessment → Performance Audit
   ```

### Workflow Triggers

**Automatic Triggers**:
- Test failure → Bug Resolution
- Performance degradation → Performance Audit
- Security alert → Security Assessment
- Production error → Incident Response

**Manual Triggers**:
- Sprint planning → Feature Development
- Compliance requirement → Security Assessment
- User feedback → Market Research

- Emergency bug fixes (minimal testing)
- Quick security patches (focused scope)

**Extended Workflows**:
- Enterprise features (additional compliance steps)
- Critical systems (extra validation phases)
- High-risk changes (multiple review cycles)

### Custom Workflow Creation
Guidelines for creating new workflows:

1. **Define Clear Objectives**
   - Specific outcomes
   - Success criteria
   - Time constraints

2. **Identify Specialists**
   - Primary roles
