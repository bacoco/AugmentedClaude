# Best Practices Repository

## Update Instructions

### For Runtime Updates
1. New practices should be validated before adding
2. Track adoption metrics automatically where possible
3. Update maturity levels based on adoption and success
4. Link related anti-patterns and practices

### Integration Protocol
```yaml
practice_submission:
  specialist: string         # Submitting specialist
  practice: object          # Full practice entry
  validation_data: array    # Evidence of effectiveness
  pilot_results: object     # Results from pilot implementation
```

### Validation Criteria
1. **Evidence-based**: Must have measurable benefits
2. **Reproducible**: Clear implementation steps
3. **Context-aware**: Clearly states when to apply
4. **Balanced**: Acknowledges trade-offs
5. **Maintained**: Regular updates based on feedback

## Query Interface

### Supported Queries
- `get_by_category(category)` - Practices by category
- `get_by_tag(tag)` - Practices by tag
- `get_by_maturity(level)` - Filter by maturity
- `get_unadopted_practices()` - Practices not yet implemented
- `get_related_practices(id)` - Related practices
- `search_practices(query)` - Full-text search

### Usage by Specialists
```python
# Example: Architect finding security practices
security_practices = best_practices.get_by_tag("security")

# Example: Developer implementing a practice
practice = best_practices.get("BP-001")
implementation_guide = practice.implementation.steps
```

## Practice Metrics Dashboard
- **Total Practices**: Count by category and maturity
- **Adoption Rate**: Average across all practices
- **Impact Score**: Weighted benefit measurements
- **Evolution Rate**: How often practices update
- **Success Rate**: Percentage meeting targets

## Practice Lifecycle
1. **Discovery**: New practice identified
2. **Validation**: Pilot implementation and measurement
3. **Documentation**: Full practice entry created
4. **Adoption**: Gradual rollout across codebase
5. **Evolution**: Continuous improvement based on feedback
6. **Standardization**: Becomes mandatory practice
