## @ Reference System

### Reference Patterns

1. **Specialist Cross-References**
   ```
   @specialists/cognitive/architect.md
   @specialists/technical/frontend-dev.md#ui-patterns
   @specialists/domain/product-manager.md#requirements
   ```

2. **Workflow Chains**
   ```
   @workflows/development/feature-development.md
   └── @workflows/development/code-review.md
       └── @workflows/development/deployment.md
   ```

3. **Pattern Inheritance**
   ```
   @patterns/architectural/microservices.md#api-gateway
   @patterns/development/testing-patterns.md#integration-tests
   ```

4. **Memory Context**
   ```
   @memory/context/project-overview.md
   @memory/sessions/current-session.md#active-decisions
   ```

5. **MCP Tool Integration**
   ```
   @shared/mcp-integration/sequential.md#reasoning-chains
   @shared/mcp-integration/magic.md#component-generation
   ```

### Smart Referencing Rules

- **Hierarchical References**: Use `#section` for specific parts
- **Conditional References**: `@if-available:specialists/domain/data-scientist.md`
- **Fallback References**: `@primary:specialist/technical/backend-dev.md @fallback:specialists/cognitive/architect.md`
- **Dynamic References**: `@current-specialist` for context-aware selection

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Start with Core Specialists
Begin by implementing the most essential specialists:
- Architect (system design)
- Analyzer (problem-solving)  
- Frontend Developer (UI implementation)
- Backend Developer (API implementation)

### 2. Establish Workflow Chains
Create clear workflow chains that connect specialists:
```
Research → Design → Implement → Test → Deploy
```

### 3. Implement @ Reference System
- Use consistent referencing patterns
- Create reference validation
- Implement smart fallbacks

### 4. Integrate MCP Tools
- Map each MCP server to appropriate specialists
- Create tool-specific workflow patterns
- Establish tool selection criteria

### 5. Build Memory System
- Implement session state tracking
- Create knowledge accumulation patterns
- Establish context preservation

## Best Practices

### @ Referencing Best Practices

1. **Use Semantic References**
   ```
   ✅ @specialists/technical/frontend-dev.md#react-patterns
   ❌ @specialists/technical/frontend-dev.md#line-45
   ```

2. **Implement Reference Validation**
   - Check reference integrity
   - Provide fallback options
   - Log broken references

3. **Create Reference Maps**
   - Document interdependencies
   - Visualize specialist relationships
   - Track usage patterns

4. **Optimize for Token Efficiency**
   - Use compressed references when appropriate
   - Implement lazy loading of referenced content
   - Cache frequently used references

### Specialist Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each specialist has one clear domain
2. **Clear Interfaces**: Defined input/output patterns
3. **Collaboration Ready**: Easy to chain with other specialists
4. **Tool Aware**: Knows which MCP tools to use
5. **Context Sensitive**: Adapts based on project context

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Specialist Selection
```yaml

  file_type:
    "*.tsx": "@specialists/technical/frontend-dev.md"
    "*.py": "@specialists/technical/backend-dev.md"
    "*.md": "@specialists/domain/tech-writer.md"
  
  error_type:
    "performance": "@specialists/cognitive/analyzer.md"
    "security": "@specialists/technical/security.md"
    "ui": "@specialists/technical/frontend-dev.md"
```

### Intelligent Workflow Routing
```yaml
workflow_rules:
  complexity_high: 
    - "@specialists/cognitive/architect.md"
    - "@specialists/orchestration/project-manager.md"
  
  complexity_medium:
    - "@specialists/technical/{domain}-dev.md"
  
  complexity_low:
    - "@commands/core/{action}.md"
```

### Collaborative Patterns
```yaml
collaboration_modes:
  parallel:
    - "@specialists/technical/frontend-dev.md"
    - "@specialists/technical/backend-dev.md"
  
  sequential:
    - "@specialists/cognitive/researcher.md"
    - "@specialists/cognitive/architect.md"  
    - "@specialists/technical/backend-dev.md"
  
  review:
    - "@specialists/technical/qa-tester.md"
    - "@specialists/technical/security.md"
```

This structure provides the optimal combination of persona-based specialization, workflow orchestration, and intelligent @ referencing for Claude Code and MCP integration.
